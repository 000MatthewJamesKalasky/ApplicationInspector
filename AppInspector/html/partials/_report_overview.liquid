    <h2>Application Inspector Report</h2>

  <h4>Overview</h4>
    Welcome to the <strong>Microsoft Application Inspector Report.</strong>
    This report represents the analysis output of the specified source code for 
    identified features and characteristics to answer the question <strong>'What is in the code?'.</strong>
    The tool can help validate purported component objectives against identifying
    patterns as well as detect feature changes between versions, including key
    security and privacy features.

    <h4>Why it's different</h4>
    Knowing what is in your software is the first step to making choices about
    what actions are appropriate before allowing it to be deployed in your own or 
    customer environments.  Unlike a typical source code static analyzer,
    Application Inspector is judgement free, focusing instead on helping inform security
    and other scenarios by surfacing details that might otherwise go unnoticed.

    A set of "Profile" attributes or features of interest are available by default. Feature attributes are identified
    as "tags" found in the rule definitions which are customizable JSON files found under the 'Rules' folder.
